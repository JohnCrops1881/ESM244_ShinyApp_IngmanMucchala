This bar chart shows California community solar projects between 2011 and 2021, by system size (kW AC) and utility. The number and capacity of total projects is not increasing steadily over time as expected. There is generally one smaller-sized project every one to three years, with 2018 as an outlier with 8 projects. In 2018, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill 100, which set a target of providing 100% of the stateâ€™s electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045. Investor-owned Pacific Gas & Electric Co. developed the most projects (7), particularly AES Distributed Energy Inc. (4). Investor-owned San Diego Gas & Electric Co. developed the largest, outlier project (20 MW). Pacific Gas & Electric serves the largest area, and it is surprising that Southern California Edison does not have a community solar project in this time because they serve a large area, with large counties in high-solar-energy desert.
