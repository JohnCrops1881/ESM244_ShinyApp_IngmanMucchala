Our Energy Justice Score draws attention to counties that meet multiple priority factors. Scores range from 0 to 4 with 4 identifying counties that meet all cut-offs: 1) energy burden (% of income) >/= 3%; 2) Annual median sunlight >= 20,000 kWh; 3) household income >= California's median household income of $91,905; 4) percent of households qualified for solar >= 85%. Central California counties stand out with the highest EJ scores, with some Northern and a Southern County also scoring a 4. These are Imperial, Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Sutter, and Yuba Counties. Many coastal counties scored zeros due to lower qualification for solar.
